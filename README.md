For this project, I worked on loading course information from a file and organizing it so a user could search for a course or view all available courses. The main challenge was making sure the information was stored in a way that made it easy and quick to access.

I decided to use a Binary Search Tree (BST) because it allows for fast searching and keeps data sorted. Understanding how different data structures work is really important because the right one can make programs much faster and easier to manage.

When I ran into roadblocks, like figuring out how to properly read the file and split the course and prerequisites, I took a step-by-step approach. I broke the tasks into small parts and tested each piece along the way, which helped me catch mistakes early and fix them without getting overwhelmed.

Working on this project taught me the value of planning before coding. Thinking through what classes, functions, and structure I needed made the coding part much easier. It also helped me realize how important it is to have a clear design in mind before starting.

This project also changed the way I write code by making me focus more on keeping it clean and organized. I now try to write smaller functions, choose better names for variables and classes, and add comments to explain what parts of the code are doing.
