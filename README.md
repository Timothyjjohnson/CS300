In this course, I worked on a project to build a Course Catalog System for ABCU. The project was broken down into three milestones that led to the final working system. The first step was to design a pseudocode outline, followed by coding the data structures and functions, and finally integrating everything into a complete application.

Working with Vectors, Hash Tables, and Binary Search Trees, then recommending one in the Project One reflection. I actually considered vector being the easiest to code.

If I had one, I would approach the problem by breaking it down into smaller, manageable tasks. Data structures were essential to this project because they allowed me to store and organize course data efficiently, ensuring that the catalog could be sorted and accessed easily.

Along the way, I encountered challenges, such as ensuring the data would load properly from the file and handling edge cases like missing prerequisites. I overcame these challenges by testing and debugging each milestone step-by-step to ensure everything worked as expected.

This project has helped me improve my ability to design a menu in a structured way and helped with the importance of writing adaptable pseudo code. It's made me more confident in my ability to break down pseudo and develop code that is structured for the future.
